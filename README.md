# Game Projects (High School)

This repository contains a collection of **game development projects created during my high school years** using **Unity**.

These projects represent my **early exposure to programming, software development, and interactive systems**, long before I focused on computer vision and artificial intelligence.

---

## 🎮 About These Projects

At the time, my primary goal was to:
- Understand how games are structured
- Learn basic programming concepts
- Build interactive systems with real-time logic
- Experiment with physics, input handling, and game mechanics

While I no longer actively develop games, these projects remain an important part of my **engineering journey**.

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 🔹 RedBall Game Project (2020)
A simple arcade-style game focused on player movement, collision handling, and level logic.

**Concepts explored:**
- Player movement & physics
- Collision detection
- Game loops
- Scene management

---

### 🔹 JumpingBall Game Project (2020)
A physics-based jumping game emphasizing timing, gravity, and player control.

**Concepts explored:**
- Physics simulation
- Gravity & forces
- Input-based control
- Real-time feedback

---

### 🔹 Summer Festivals Game Project (2021)
A more complex game project developed as part of an early experimentation phase with game design and mechanics.

**Concepts explored:**
- Game flow design
- Multiple gameplay elements
- Scene transitions
- Asset integration

---

### 🔹 TÜBİTAK 2204-D Competition Project (2022–2023)
A game-based project developed for the TÜBİTAK 2204-D competition, combining gameplay mechanics with structured project planning.

**Concepts explored:**
- Structured project development
- Game logic architecture
- Team-based or competition-oriented development
- Iterative improvement

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Unity**
- **C#**
- Basic physics and animation systems
- Game object and component-based architecture

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

Although I no longer actively develop games, these projects are preserved to:
- Show my **early technical background**
- Demonstrate how I approached problem-solving from a young age
- Highlight my transition from game development to **computer vision and AI**

They provide context for how my interest evolved from interactive systems to more advanced computational fields.

## 📌 Notes

- These projects are **not actively maintained**
- The code reflects my skill level at the time of development
- The purpose is documentation and historical reference rather than production readiness

## 🚀 Current Focus

My current work focuses on:
- Computer Vision
- Deep Learning
- Artificial Intelligence Engineering
- Applied machine learning systems
